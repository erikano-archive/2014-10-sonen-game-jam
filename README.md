[Sonen Game Jam](http://sonengamejam.org/), October 2014

Team Erik

We were given 48 hours (actually 49 hours because of Daylight Savings Time).

This game is unfinished.

Dependencies
------------

* **libSDL2**, assumed to be installed with prefix `/usr/local` (since that is where it was put by the script https://github.com/Keyaku/SDL2_RasPi_Install which I used to install it on my Raspbian-running Raspberry Pi). If that is not where it is located on your machine, modify the `Makefile` of this here game accordingly.

Compiling
---------

`make`

Running
-------

`./bin/limit`
